#### Lab 3 â€“ MongoDB & Node.js REST API Development

This lab series introduces how to build a **Node.js + MongoDB** application from the ground up â€” starting with a cloud database, then connecting it through Express and Mongoose, and finally creating a full REST API with CRUD operations.

The lab is divided into three main parts:

#### Part 1 â€“ MongoDB Cloud Setup

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Create and configure a MongoDB Atlas account.
- Deploy your first database cluster using the free plan.
- Add collections and documents (`DBFilms` â†’ `ColFilms`).
- Obtain and configure your database connection string for Node.js.

#### Part 2 â€“ Connecting Node.js to MongoDB

Youâ€™ll continue by developing a small API called MiniFilms, connecting it to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Scaffold an Express project.
- Organize your project with routes and models.
- Define a Mongoose schema for films.
- Fetch and display data from your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

#### Part 3 â€“ Building the MiniPost REST Microservice

Youâ€™ll create a fully functional CRUD microservice called MiniPost that performs:

- Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Connection to MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose
- Route handling with Express
- Environment configuration using dotenv
