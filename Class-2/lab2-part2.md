### Lab 2: Part 2 - Introduction to NodeJS with express

By the end of this part, you will be able to:  
- Set up a basic Node.js project with Express.  
- Create simple routes and run your first web server.  
- Start and stop the server from the terminal.  

Letâ€™s set up our very first Node.js server using Express.

1. Let's start with a fresh project. Go to your `Documents` folder (or anywhere you prefer) and create a new folder called `lab2-hello`.
2. In VSC, open a new folder.

3. In the terminal, we need to initialize our project. In the terminal, Iâ€™ll type:

```shell
npm init -y
```

This creates a package.json file, which keeps track of our projectâ€™s settings and dependencies.

4. Next, letâ€™s install Express, which is the framework weâ€™ll use, and Nodemon, which will restart our server automatically whenever we make changes.

```shell
npm install express nodemon
```

5. Now, we need to tell Node how to start our server. So inside the `package.json` file, Iâ€™ll adapt the scripts section to look like this:

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon app.js"
}
```

>  That way, every time I run `npm start`, Nodemon will launch `app.js` and keep it running.

6. Now letâ€™s actually create the server. Create a new file called `app.js` and in the file, Iâ€™ll start by importing Express:

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```

Then Iâ€™ll define my first route, the home route, just `/`.

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello world!")
})
```

Let's define a second route.

```js
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
    res.send("world!")
})
```

Finally, we need to make the server listen on a port. Iâ€™ll pick port `3000`.

```js
app.listen(3000)
```

Here is how it looks like.

7. Now if I go back to the terminal and type:

```shell
npm start
```

The server is running. If I open my browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`, Iâ€™ll see the **Hello world!**

Try the `http://localhost:3000/hello` endpoint too.

8. Press click within the terminal area and then `CTRL`+`C` to stop the server.

> (Hold the `Control` key and press `C`).

ðŸŽ‰ Thatâ€™s it, we just built our very first Express server! This small app is the foundation for building APIs and web applications.
