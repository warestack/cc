### Lab 2: Part 1 - JavaScript fundamentals

#### What you will learn

In this part of the lab, you will learn the basics of JavaScript and how to run your first program using Node.js.  If you already know Python, many of the concepts will feel familiar, the main difference is the syntax.

#### Step 1: JavaScipt fundamentals

1. You will need to create a folder to store your project data. Go to your `Documents` (or any folder you prefer) in your computer and create a new folder called `js-tutorial`.

2. Open **Visual Studio Code (VSC)** and then open the folder you just created as your project.

3. The folder `js-tutorial` is now open.

#### Step 2 JavaScript Basics Tutorial

JavaScript (often called JS) is a programming language of the web. It was first created to make websites interactive (e.g. buttons, forms, animations).  

Today, JavaScript is much more powerful:  
- It runs in the browser (frontend) to control web pages.  
- It runs on the server (backend) using Node.js.  
- Itâ€™s used to build web apps, mobile apps, games, and even desktop software.  

Let's explore the basics.

1. Add the following code in your `app.js`.

```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

> `console.log()` prints text to the console.

2. Open a new terminal (if not already open). To open a new terminal click on the `Terminal` and then `New Terminal`.

Let's run the `app.js` using the following command in the terminal.

```shell
node app.js
```

This is how my `app.js` file looks like.

âœ… Congratulations! You just ran your very first JavaScript program.

#### Step 3 Learning the basics of JS

1. In JS, you can define variables using the `let` and the `const`  (for constant variables).

   Hereâ€™s how to define a changeable variable (`name`) and a constant one (`pi`).

```js
// Using let (can change)
let name = "John";
console.log(name);
name = "Kate"
console.log(name)

// Using const (cannot change)
const pi = 3.1415;
console.log(pi);
```

2. Let's explore the basic JS data types.

```js
let text = "Hello";      // String
let number = 42;         // Number
let isActive = true;     // Boolean
let nothing = null;      // Null
let notDefined;          // Undefined
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; // Array
let person = { name: "John", age: 25 };     // Object
```

3. Basic operators in JavaScript look just like Python.

```js
let x = 10;
let y = 3;

console.log(x + y); // 13
console.log(x - y); // 7
console.log(x * y); // 30
console.log(x / y); // 3.333...
console.log(x % y); // 1 (remainder)
```

4. In JS, code blocks use the curly braces.

- In JavaScript: `if`, `for`, `functions`, etc. use curly braces `{ }`.  
- In Python, code blocks use indentation (spaces or tabs).  

Here is an example of a JS conditional block.

```js
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("A grade");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("B grade");
} else {
  console.log("C grade");
}
```

5. Explore a `for` and a `while` loop.

```js
// For loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number " + i);
}

// While loop
let n = 1;
while (n <= 3) {
  console.log("Count " + n);
  n++;
}
```

6. Creating JS functions are quite similar as Python.

```js
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
console.log(greet("John")); // Hello John
console.log(greet("Maria")); // Hello Maria
```

7. This is a JavaScript object, which works very much like a Python dictionary.  

   * Objects are at the heart of modern APIs because they let us store data in keyâ€“value pairs (e.g., `name: "Mary"`, `age: 25`). 
* Try the following code block.

```python
let student = {
  name: "Mary",
  age: 25,
  major: "Computer Science"
};

console.log(student.name);      // Mary
console.log(student["major"]);  // Computer Science
```

>  This structure makes it easy to organize and send data between applications, especially in JSON format, which is just a text version of objects.  
>
> ðŸ‘‰ In short: objects are the main way information is shared in web apps and APIs.

8. In JavaScript, an array is very similar to a list in Python. Both store a collection of values in order, and you can access them using an index that starts at `0`.  

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

console.log(colors[0]); // red
console.log(colors.length); // 3

colors.push("yellow"); // add at end
console.log(colors); 
```

9. Finally, letâ€™s look at a **JSON array of objects**. 
   
   This is very common in real-world APIs: you get a list (array) of objects, where each object has keys and values.  

```js
let students = [
  { id: "s1", name: "John Smith" },
  { id: "s2", name: "Maria Garcia" },
  { id: "s3", name: "Ali Khan" }
];

console.log(students[0].name); // John Smith
console.log(students[1].id);   // s2
```

#### Exercise

Try it yourself: Loop through the array and log the title of every book.

```js
[
  { id: "b1", title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", year: 1949 },
  { id: "b2", title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee", year: 1960 },
  { id: "b3", title: "The Hobbit", author: "J.R.R. Tolkien", year: 1937 }
]
```

> ðŸš€ Avoid scrolling down to the solution until youâ€™ve tried it.

#### Solution

```js
// Loop through each book in the array
let books = [
  { id: "b1", title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", year: 1949 },
  { id: "b2", title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", author: "Harper Lee", year: 1960 },
  { id: "b3", title: "The Hobbit", author: "J.R.R. Tolkien", year: 1937 }
];

for (let i = 0; i < books.length; i++) {
  console.log("ID:", books[i].id);
  console.log("Title:", books[i].title);
  console.log("Author:", books[i].author);
  console.log("Year:", books[i].year);
  console.log("---");
}
```
Close your folder from the top menu (`File` - `Close Folder`).
